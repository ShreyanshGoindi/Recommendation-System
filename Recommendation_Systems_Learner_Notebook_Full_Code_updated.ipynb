        "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity and variety throughout the globe. This has lead to information overload, and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers and they often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help recommending products to consumers while they are browsing online. Providing personalized recommendations which is most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help business.\n",
        "\n",
        "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations in its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences in order to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",

        "- **Deploy the optimized SVD model** for personalized recommendations to the majority of users.\n",
        "- Implement **popularity-based recommendations** for new users/products as a temporary solution.\n",
        "- Set up **A/B testing** to monitor improvements in click-through rates, conversions, and user engagement.\n",
        "- Establish **performance monitoring** for RMSE, precision, recall, and F1 score with regular model retraining.\n",
        "- Plan for **hybrid and real-time updating models** in next development phases to adapt to changing user preferences.\n",
        "- Design for **scalability** to support millions of users and products efficiently.\n",
